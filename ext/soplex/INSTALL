1.	All the documentation is available online at 

        http://soplex.zib.de

	You can also generate it, if you have doxgen installed by 
        typing 'make doc'. It will then be in doc/html/index.html.
        On some systems, it might be necessary to use 'gmake' instead
        of 'make'.

2.	Compiling

	Read the documentation!

        For the impatient:
        
	On systems with GNU gcc4.2
	and greater               :  make COMP=gnu OPT=opt-gcc42
	On systems with GNU g++   :  make COMP=gnu OPT=opt
	Linux/x86 with Intel C++  :  make COMP=intel OPT=opt
        Tru64 with Compaq C++     :  make COMP=compaq OPT=opt
        Solaris with SUN Forte C++:  make COMP=sun OPT=opt
        IRIX with SGI Mips Pro C++:  make COMP=sgi OPT=opt
	HP-UX with HP aCC         :  make COMP=hp OPT=opt
        AIX with VisualAge C++    :  make COMP=ibm OPT=opt

        Then get and unpack in the check directory the Netlib testset from 
        http://soplex.zib.de/download.shtml
        and say make COMP=<as before> OPT=<as before> check
        This should report no fails.

        Now read the documentation!

3.1	Using SoPlex

	Start one of the binaries in the bin directory with the -h flag.

3.2	Using the library

    	Examples on how to use the SoPlex library is provided in the files
	'src/soplexmain.cpp' and 'src/simpleexample.cpp'.

4.	Bug report

	If you find any bugs, or LP-files were SoPlex fails to find the
	optimal solution, please report to koch@zib.de.

5.	Publications

	Any publication for which SoPlex has been used must include an
	aknowledge ment and a reference to the Ph.D. thesis:

	Roland Wunderling,
	"Paralleler und Objekt-orientierter Simplex-Algorithmus",
	ZIB technical report TR 96-09, Berlin 1996

	A copy of the thesis can be retreived from
	www.zib.de/Publications/abstracts/TR-96-09/
